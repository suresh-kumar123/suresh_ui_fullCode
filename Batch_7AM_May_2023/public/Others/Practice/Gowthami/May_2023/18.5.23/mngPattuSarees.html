    <h2><u>different type of sarees</u> </h2>
    <h3>1.Baluchari saree</h3>
    <p>Women across India and Bangladesh widely wear the Baluchari saree.
         It originated in Bengal and is known for depicting mythological 
         scenes on the saree pallu. It is mainly produced in Murshidabad 
         and started in a small village called Baluchari from where it got 
         its name. Producing one saree takes approximately one week or more.
          The silk yarn used in the weaving of the baluchari silk saree is 
          not twisted and therefore has a soft, heavy texture. Balucharis 
          have threads in one to two colors along with attractive meenakari 
          work whereas, gorgeous Balucharis woven with gold-colored threads
           sometimes silver are called Swarnacharis.</p><hr>
