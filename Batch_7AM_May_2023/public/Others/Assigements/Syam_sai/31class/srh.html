    <p><i> Sunrisers Hyderabad (stylised as SunRisers Hyderabad, abbr. SRH) are a franchise cricket team based in
            Hyderabad, Telangana, India, that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL).[4] The franchise is owned by
            Kalanithi Maran of the SUN Group and was founded in 2012 after the Hyderabad-based Deccan Chargers were
            terminated by the IPL.[5] The team is currently coached by Brian Lara and captained by Aiden Markram. Their
            primary home ground is the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, Hyderabad, which has capacity of
            55,000.<br>

            The team made their first IPL appearance in 2013, where they reached the playoffs, eventually finishing in
            fourth place. The Sunrisers won their maiden IPL title in the 2016 season, defeating the Royal Challengers
            Bangalore by 8 runs in the final. The team has qualified for the play-off stage of the tournament in every
            season since 2016. In 2018, the team reached the finals of the Indian Premier League, but lost to Chennai
            Super Kings. The team is considered one of the best bowling sides, often admired for its ability to defend
            low totals. David Warner is the leading run scorer for the side, having won the Orange Cap three times, in
            2015, 2017, and 2019.[7] Bhuvneshwar Kumar is the leading wicket-taker having won the Purple Cap twice, in
            2016 and 2017.[8][9] The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the brand value of the Sunrisers Hyderabad which saw a
            decline of 4 percent to US$57.4 million in 2020 as the overall brand value of the IPL decreased to US$4.4
            billion, according to Brand Finance.<br>

            Sunrisers Hyderabad replaced the Deccan Chargers in 2012 and debuted in 2013. The franchise was taken over
            by Sun TV Network after the Deccan Chronicle went bankrupt. The squad was announced in Chennai on 18
            December 2012. The team is owned by Sun TV Network who won the bid with â‚¹85.05 crore (US$11 million) per
            year for a five-year deal, a week after the Chargers were terminated due to prolonged financial issues. Sun
            TV Network Limited, which is headquartered in Chennai, is one of India's biggest television networks with 32
            TV channels and 45 FM radio stations, making it India's largest media and entertainment company.<br></i></p>
