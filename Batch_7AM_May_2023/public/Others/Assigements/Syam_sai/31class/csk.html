    <p> Chennai Super Kings (CSK) is an Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise cricket team based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu,
        India. Founded in 2008, the team plays its home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The team is
        owned by India Cements Limited through the Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited holding company. CSK is the most
        successful team of the tournament with record 5 titles, 10 finals and 12 playoff appearances in 14 seasons.[1]
        The team is captained by MS Dhoni and coached by Stephen Fleming. In January 2022, CSK became India's first
        unicorn sports enterprise.<br>

        The team was suspended for two years from the IPL starting July 2015 due to the involvement of its owners in the
        2013 IPL betting case,[3] and won the title in its comeback season of 2018.

        <br> Super Kings have won the IPL title five times (in 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021, and 2023).

        In addition, they have also won the Champions League Twenty20 in 2010 and 2014. They are amongst the most
        valuable IPL franchises with a valuation of roughly $1.15 billion as of 2022.</p>
