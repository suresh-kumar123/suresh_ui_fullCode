    <p><i> Royal Challengers Bangalore (often abbreviated as RCB) are a franchise cricket team based in Bengaluru,
            Karnataka, that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL). It was founded in 2008 by United Spirits and named
            after the company's liquor brand Royal Challenge.<br>

            The Royal Challengers have not won the IPL but finished runners-up on three occasions between 2009 and 2016.
            The team holds the records of both the highest and the lowest totals in the IPL – 263/5 and 49
            respectively.<br>
            In September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the
            Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.[4] The teams for the competition,
            representing 8 different cities of India, including Bangalore, were put up on auction in Mumbai on 20
            February 2008. The Bangalore franchise was purchased by Vijay Mallya, who paid US$111.6 million for it. This
            was the second highest bid for a team, next only to Reliance Industries' bid of US$111.9 million for the
            Mumbai Indians.<br>

            The brand value of Royal Challengers Bangalore was estimated to be ₹595 crore (US$75 million) in 2019,
            according to a survey conducted by Duff & Phelps.</i></p>
