            Amid Opposition's Boycott Call For New Parliament Opening, 2 Parties Accept Invite

            New Delhi: As the inauguration of the new parliament by PM Narendra Modi sparked a row, with many parties announcing a boycott of the event, both Biju Janata Dal and YSRCP on Wednesday announced their decision to attend the inaugural ceremony.
            In a letter issued by BJD spokesperson Lenin Mohanty, announcing the participation of the party MPs in the inaugural function, the party said that it believes that the parliament as a symbol of democracy was above politics, and its authority and stature should always be safeguarded. "BJD believes that these constitutional institutions should be above any issue that may affect their sanctity and honour. Such issues can always be discussed in the august house," it said. Currently, the party has 12 MPs in the Lok Sabha and eight in the Rajya Sabha.The president of India is the head of the Indian State. The parliament represents 1.4 billion people of India. Both the institutions are symbols of Indian democracy and draw their authority from the constitution of India," the letter said.The inauguration of the new parliament is scheduled to be held on Sunday. Nineteen opposition parties, including the Congress and Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party, on Wednesday issued a joint statement announcing the boycott and called the inauguration a “grave insult” and "direct assault" on democracy. They had flagged that president Draupadi Murmu was not unveiling it, which was an insult to the nation.
