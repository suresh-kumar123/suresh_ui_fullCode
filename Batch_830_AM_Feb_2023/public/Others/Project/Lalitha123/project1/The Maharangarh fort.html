    <h1>The Maharangarh fort</h1>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Mehrangarh_Fort.jpg/1280px-Mehrangarh_Fort.jpg">
    <p>ehrangarh Fort covers an area of 1,200 acres (486 hectares) in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. The complex is located on a hilltop around 122 metres above the surrounding plain,[1] and was constructed c.â€‰1459 by Rajput ruler Rao Jodha, though most of the existing structure is from the 17th century. Inside its boundaries there are several palaces known for their intricate carvings and expansive courtyards, as well as a museum housing various relics. A winding road leads to and from the city below. The imprints of the impact of cannonballs fired by attacking armies of Jaipur can still be seen on the second gate. At the north-east of the fort is the chhatri of Kirat Singh Soda, a soldier who fell on the spot defending Mehrangarh.

        There are seven gates, which include Jai Pol (meaning 'victory gate'), built by Maharaja Man Singh to commemorate his victories over the Jaipur and Bikaner armies in 1806. The Fattehpol (also meaning 'victory gate'), commemorates victory of Maharaja Ajit Singh over the Mughals.</p>
