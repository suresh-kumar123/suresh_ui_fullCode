    and these all tags they alsohave  a closing tag and last tag that we learn tody is BR tag br tag means break row </p>
    <h2>Second Content </h2> <hr><br>
    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is 
        that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. 
        Many desktop
         publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web 
        sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
    <h3>Third Content</h3> <hr> <br>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
         unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled            it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
          typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus 
        PageMaker includi</p><br>
        <pre id="new">There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
             randomised words which don't look even slightly                   believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything 
             embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the 
             first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, \
            to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</pre>
