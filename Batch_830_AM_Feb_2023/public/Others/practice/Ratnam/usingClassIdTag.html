    <p class="newsContent sample">  Alphabet's Google is rolling out tests that block access to news content 
        for some Canadian users, the company confirmed on
        Wednesday, in what it says is a test
        run of a potential response to the government's online news bill.
        The "Online News Act," or House of Commons bill C-18, introduced in April by Justin Trudeau's Liberal government,
        laid out rules to force platforms
        like Meta's Facebook and Google to negotiate commercial deals and pay news publishers for their content.
