       Alphabet's Google is rolling out tests that block access to news content 
       for some Canadian users, the company confirmed on
       Wednesday, in what it says is a test
       run of a potential response to the government's online news bill.
       The "Online News Act," or House of Commons bill C-18, introduced in April by Justin Trudeau's Liberal government,
       laid out rules to force platforms
       like Meta's Facebook and Google to negotiate commercial deals and pay news publishers for their content.
